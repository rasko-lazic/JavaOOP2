Adonis Blue
Males have beautiful, brilliant sky-blue wings, while the females are brown. A characteristic butterfly of unimproved chalk downland in southern England.
This beautiful butterfly is one of the most characteristic species of southern chalk downland, where it flies low over shortly grazed turf.
The males have brilliant sky-blue wings, while the females are brown and far less conspicuous. Both sexes have distinctive black lines that enter or cross the white fringes to the wings. Despite its restricted distribution, the butterfly can be seen in many hundreds on good sites.
