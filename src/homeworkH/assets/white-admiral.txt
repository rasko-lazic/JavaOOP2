White Admiral
Widespread in southern England, extending just into Wales and northwards. The butterfly has white-banded black wings and a distinctive delicate flight with short periods of wing beats, followed by long glides. It could be confused with the larger Purple Emperor.
Adults are often found nectaring on Bramble flowers in rides and clearings. It is a fairly shade-tolerant butterfly, flying in dappled sunlight to lay eggs on Honeysuckle.
The White Admiral occurs widely in southern Britain and has spread rapidly since the 1920s, after an earlier contraction. However, population monitoring has shown a dramatic decline in the last 20 years for reasons that are as yet unclear.
