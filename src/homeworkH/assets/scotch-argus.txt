Scotch Argus
Very dark brown with row of black eyespots with white centre on each wing. Eyespots are surrounded by orange.
As its name suggests, this butterfly is found predominantly in Scotland where it flies in tall, damp grassland. In sunshine, males fly almost without rest, weaving low through the grass in search of a mate. In poorer weather they perch on grass clumps, flying out to investigate any passing brown butterflies. The females are far less conspicuous and spend most of their time basking.
The Scotch Argus is common and widespread in Scotland but has declined in the southern part of its range, especially in England where it is reduced to just two isolated sites.
